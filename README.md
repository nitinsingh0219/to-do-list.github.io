## Introduction

The To-Do List Web Application is a simple and user-friendly tool to keep track of your tasks and manage your daily activities effectively. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when they are no longer needed. This project is perfect for learning the basics of web development and can be extended for more complex scenarios.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
- Mark tasks as completed to keep track of your progress.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Task data is stored locally in the browser, so you can close the application and return to your tasks later.
- Mobile-responsive design for use on various devices.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build this To-Do List Web Application:

- HTML5: For creating the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS3: For styling and layout of the application.
- JavaScript: To add interactivity and functionality to the web app.
- localStorage: To store the task data locally in the browser.
